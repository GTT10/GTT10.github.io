Of course, here are the solutions to the 2023 exam problems.

**(1) Elongation from End Masses Only**

When ignoring the rod's mass, the elongation is due to the centrifugal force from the two end masses[cite: 57].

  * **Centrifugal Force:** The centrifugal force `F` generated by each mass `m` at a distance `l/2` from the center is:
    $F = m r \\omega^2 = m \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right) \\omega^2$
  * **Elongation:** This force creates a constant tension `F` throughout the rod. The total elongation $\\delta$ is calculated using the standard formula for a bar under tension. We can find the elongation of one half of the rod (length `l/2`) and double it.
    $\\delta = 2 \\times \\frac{F (l/2)}{AE} = \\frac{F l}{AE}$
    Here, `A` is the cross-sectional area ($\\pi d^2 / 4$) and `E` is the Young's modulus[cite: 56].
    Substituting the expressions for `F` and `A`:
    $$\delta = \frac{\left(\frac{ml\omega^2}{2}\right)l}{\left(\frac{\pi d^2}{4}\right)E} = \frac{2 m l^2 \omega^2}{\pi E d^2}$$

**(2) Elongation Including Rod's Mass**

When considering the rod's own mass, the tensile force is no longer constant but varies along the rod's length[cite: 58].

  * **Variable Tensile Force:** At any distance `x` from the center, the tensile force $T(x)$ is the sum of the centrifugal force from the end mass and the force from the portion of the rod from `x` to the end.
      * Force from end mass: $F\_{mass} = \\frac{ml\\omega^2}{2}$
      * Force from the rod's outer section: $F\_{rod}(x) = \\int\_x^{l/2} (\\rho A dr) r \\omega^2 = \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)$
      * Total Force: $T(x) = F\_{mass} + F\_{rod}(x) = \\frac{ml\\omega^2}{2} + \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{l^2}{4} - x^2\\right)$
  * **Elongation:** The total elongation is found by integrating the elongation of an infinitesimal element `dx` over the length of the rod.
    $\\delta = \\int\_{-l/2}^{l/2} \\frac{T(x)}{AE} dx = 2 \\int\_{0}^{l/2} \\frac{T(x)}{AE} dx$
    This integral results in two terms: the elongation from the end masses (calculated in Part 1) and the elongation from the rod's own mass.
    $$\delta = \underbrace{\frac{2 m l^2 \omega^2}{\pi E d^2}}_{\text{from end mass}} + \underbrace{\frac{\rho \omega^2 l^3}{12E}}_{\text{from rod mass}}$$

### **Problem 2: Torsion of a Fixed Shaft**

This problem involves a statically indeterminate composite shaft fixed at both ends and subjected to two torques[cite: 70].

**(1) Polar Second Moment of Area**

For a solid circular shaft of diameter `d`, the polar second moment of area, `J`, is a geometric property representing its resistance to torsion[cite: 71].
$$J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}$$

-----

**(2) Torque in Each Section**

To solve this statically indeterminate problem, we express the internal torque in each section in terms of one of the unknown reaction torques. The question specifies not to use $T\_A$, so we work from the right end (B)[cite: 72]. Let torques in the direction of $T\_1$ and $T\_2$ be positive.

  * **Section DB:** The internal torque $T\_{DB}$ must balance the reaction torque at the wall, $T\_B$.
    $$T_{DB} = -T_B$$
  * **Section CD:** The torque $T\_{CD}$ balances $T\_B$ and the applied torque $T\_2$.
    $$T_{CD} = T_2 - T_B$$
  * **Section AC:** The torque $T\_{AC}$ balances $T\_B$, $T\_2$, and $T\_1$.
    $$T_{AC} = T_1 + T_2 - T_B$$

-----

**(3) Angle of Twist in Each Section**

The angle of twist $\\phi$ for each section is calculated using the formula $\\phi = \\frac{TL}{GJ}$[cite: 73].

  * **Section AC ($\\phi\_{AC}$):**
    $$\phi_{AC} = \frac{T_{AC} \cdot a}{G_1 J} = \frac{(T_1 + T_2 - T_B)a}{G_1 J}$$
  * **Section CD ($\\phi\_{CD}$):**
    $$\phi_{CD} = \frac{T_{CD} \cdot b}{G_2 J} = \frac{(T_2 - T_B)b}{G_2 J}$$
  * **Section DB ($\\phi\_{DB}$):**
    $$\phi_{DB} = \frac{T_{DB} \cdot c}{G_1 J} = \frac{-T_B c}{G_1 J}$$

-----

**(4) Reaction Torques $T\_A$ and $T\_B$**

Since the shaft is fixed at both ends, the total angle of twist from A to B is zero[cite: 70]. This provides the compatibility equation needed to solve for the reactions[cite: 74].

  * **Solving for $T\_B$:**
    $\\phi\_{AB} = \\phi\_{AC} + \\phi\_{CD} + \\phi\_{DB} = 0$
    $\\frac{(T\_1 + T\_2 - T\_B)a}{G\_1 J} + \\frac{(T\_2 - T\_B)b}{G\_2 J} - \\frac{T\_B c}{G\_1 J} = 0$
    Solving this equation for $T\_B$ gives:
    $$T_B = \frac{a G_2 (T_1 + T_2) + b G_1 T_2}{(a+c)G_2 + b G_1}$$
  * **Solving for $T\_A$:**
    From overall static equilibrium, $T\_A + T\_B = T\_1 + T\_2$. Substituting the expression for $T\_B$:
    $T\_A = T\_1 + T\_2 - T\_B$
    $$T_A = \frac{c G_2 (T_1 + T_2) + b G_1 T_1}{(a+c)G_2 + b G_1}$$
